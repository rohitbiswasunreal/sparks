Sparks Foundation Internship Project: Basic Banking System

The Basic Banking System is a web application used to transfer money between multiple users. The project includes 10 dummy users, and new dummy users can also be created. The technology stack used for this project is as follows:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript
Back-end: PHP
Database: MySQL

The database consists of two tables: Users Table and Transaction Table.

The Users Table contains basic fields such as name, email, and current balance. It stores the information of all the users participating in the banking system.

The Transaction Table records all the transfers that have occurred, along with the timestamp of each transaction. This table keeps track of the history of transactions made between the users.

Please note that this is a basic overview of the Sparks Foundation Internship Project: Basic Banking System. To implement the project, you will need to design the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You will also need to write the necessary PHP code for the back-end logic, such as transferring money between users and updating the transaction records in the database. Additionally, you will need to set up a MySQL database to store the user and transaction information.
